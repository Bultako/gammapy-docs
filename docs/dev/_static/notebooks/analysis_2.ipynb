    "\n",
    "This should be a 10-15 min read tutorial, where we re-do the analysis from `analysis1.ipynb`, but using the lower-level API (Python classes) instead of YAML config.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could either just show the exact same analysis again, explaining in more detail what `Analysis` does under the hood.\n",
    "Or we could go a bit further, explaining e.g. how to do something custom that isn't possibly with `Analysis`, e.g. some complex observation selection or grouping, or complex background modeling.\n",

    "Not that this should be short, and at the end link to `overview.ipynb` and other analysis tutorials."
