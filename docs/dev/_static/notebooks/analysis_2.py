# # Second analysis
# 
# **TODO: write this tutorial. Suggest to limit scope to data reduction, showing how to produce and store datasets.**
# 
# This should be a 10-15 min read tutorial, where we re-do the analysis from `analysis1.ipynb`, but using the lower-level API (Python classes) instead of YAML config.
# 
# We could either just show the exact same analysis again, explaining in more detail what `Analysis` does under the hood.
# Or we could go a bit further, explaining e.g. how to do something custom that isn't possibly with `Analysis`, e.g. some complex observation selection or grouping, or complex background modeling.
# 
# Not that this should be short, and at the end link to `overview.ipynb` and other analysis tutorials.
