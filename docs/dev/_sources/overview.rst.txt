Overview
========

**TODO: give a big-picture overview of Gammapy**
Should be a 5 - 10 min read, including nice diagram figures.

Gammapy workflow
----------------

- From Datastore to Observations to Datasets to Fit.
- How Analysis orchestrates this.

DL3 data format
---------------

- Events (link to relevant doc)
- IRFs (link to relevant doc)

Data reduction
--------------

- Producing reduced data to prepare for modeling and fitting.
- Rapid description of the typical data reduction chains (possibly link to some notebooks)

Modeling and Fitting
--------------------

- Forward-folding and Likelihood-based analyses (link to stats)
- Models (link to model.ipynb)
- Typical operations with links to notebooks
